# My Go Learning Journey - Simple API Project

![Golang Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Go_Logo_Blue.svg/1200px-Go_Logo_Blue.svg.png)

Welcome to my Go learning adventure! This project is a simple API system built using Gorm, PostgreSQL, and Gorilla/Mux in the Go programming language. It serves as my playground to explore the intricacies of Go, a statically typed language known for its efficiency and widespread use in advanced backend development.

## Why do I want to learn GO language?

- **Static Type System**: Go has a static type system. This feature reveals errors due to type mismatches during the compilation stage, ensuring a safer code development process.

- **Speed and Performance**: Go language boasts high compilation speed and runtime performance. This provides a fast development process and impressive application performance. Additionally, the language's lightweight design allows for more efficient utilization of resources.

- **Backend Powerhouse**: Go has become a popular choice for backend development, and its simplicity, performance, and ease of use make it an ideal language for server-side applications.

- **Blockchain Development**: With the rising prominence of blockchain technologies, many node software implementations are written in Go.

## Get Started

If you're curious about my learning journey or want to explore the code, feel free to dive into the project. You can run it locally by following these steps:

<ins>_Don't forget to install PostgreSQL on your local computer._</ins>

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:grkmyvz/basic-golang-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd basic-golang-api`
3. Run the application: `go run main.go`

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even join me on this learning adventure!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
